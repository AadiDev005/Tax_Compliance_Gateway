# System Design: Tax Compliance Gateway

## Overview
A self-hosted, multi-jurisdiction tax compliance platform using microservices.

## Services
- **API Gateway**: Gin-based, routes to services via REST/GraphQL.
- **Tax Engine**: Go service for tax calculations (e.g., VAT, SAT).
- **Document Processor**: Handles invoice parsing (XML, JSON, PDF).
- **Compliance Tracker**: Monitors regulatory compliance.
- **Notification Service**: Sends alerts (email, Slack, webhooks).
- **Analytics Service**: Processes metrics for dashboards.
- **Audit Service**: Maintains immutable audit trails.

## Communication
- **Sync**: gRPC/REST between services.
- **Async**: Kafka for event-driven workflows.

## Data Stores
- **PostgreSQL**: Transactional data (tax rules, users).
- **MongoDB**: Documents (invoices, regulatory changes).
- **Redis**: Caching.
- **Kafka**: Event streaming.
